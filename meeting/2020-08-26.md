# Meeting notes

-  Wow, so much empty

## Structs

- Values to structs's fields can be assigned in 3 different way: by order, specifying the value variable and using the . notation (a_struct.field).
- printf vs println can be used to print just the values of the struct or print the names of the fields as well
- multiline structs need to have every line separated by comma including the last one, this is going to be a Paint the rear since we are more used to json.

## Pointers

* = value
& = address

* Turns addres into value : *address
& Turns value into addres : &value 

- when you see * where a type should be, it means it is a description to a type

Value types: worry about pointers (int, float, string, bool, structs)
Reference types: don't worry, be happy (slices, maps, channels, pointers, functions)
