# Notes

Apparently I am the only lazy as$h)l3 that decided not to type the numbers from 1 to 10, but to let the computer do it for me. In my defense, my code can escale up easier.

Also I learned a bit about printfn vs println, println can't take formatting like %d for ints so I had to go back to printf. Also I didn't really need the formating, I could have just printed the int first with println lol.
